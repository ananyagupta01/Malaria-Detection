# Malaria-Detection
Designed and built a Malaria Detector which will tell a person is suffering from malaria or not.

STEPS:
step 1 : Read the original image

step 2 : Convert to grayscale image (because we are more intreseted in patterns)

step 3 : Contour Detection (it will map all the boundries of contours in the region)

step 4 : Get areas of 5 largest contours (in uninfected image there will be only 1 contour and in infected image there will be more than 1 contour)
